# {{ site.serverName }}

Pinnacle SMP is a traditional, mostly-vanilla Minecraft multiplayer server running Java 1.18.1. Everyone is welcome to join as long as they're a member of the BitGardener discord server. We are currently not whitelisted at launch, but may add a whitelist depending on the active player count.

# What's different on this server?

 - Villager trading mechanics have been adjusted to help balance the player economy.
 - Players can claim land to avoid being griefed or stolen. (we want to stay vanilla, but this feels like a necessary change to protect players)
 - 8 emeralds can be crafted into a diamond and 1 diamond into 8 emeralds using a crafting table. Emeralds are not renewable.
 - There is a large shopping district set up at spawn so that players can create shops and sell their items.
 - The [Shopkeepers plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers) allows players to make protected villager shops so that they can sell items without fear of being robbed.
 - There are 3 portals in the spawn tower that send the player to various points on the map (to enter the wilderness more quickly). Players must build 200 blocks outside of these portals.

# How does the shopping district work?

 - There are a large number of plots designated around spawn by leaf hedges. Each of these is a shopping district plot.
 - To claim one as your own, simply choose a plot and place your stuff there. Recommended: also claim this land to avoid griefing.
 - Only claim the land between the leaf walls, not the leaf walls themselves.
 - [Shopkeeper villagers](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers) can be used to set prices for your items. They can be spawned via a villager spawn egg, which you can get from the second floor of the spawn tower.
 - Feel free to decorate your shop as much or as little as you would like! Make sure to advertise and the business will start rolling in.

# Villager trades & emerald balancing

 - I made several changes to villager trades that may be controversial, but I've tested them thoroughly & I think they're what we need to have a healthy economy and avoid the shops being flooded with 1-diamond cost end-game gear and enchantments. Villagers are unfortunately a bit too strong on most vanilla survival servers & mean that players joining even a few days late will have a pretty big disadvantage. This helps prevent players getting extremely cheap max level gear overnight.
 - Emeralds are no longer renewable, so all emeralds must be mined or crafted from diamonds (1 diamond = 8 emeralds as a crafting recipe).
 - All villager trades that give the player emeralds are replaced with a trade of 1 diamond for 1 emerald. This trade is not worth the diamond but it will instantly level your villager up to the next rank (it gives extra experience points).
 - Mending is set to a fixed cost of 64 emeralds, which is the equivalent of 8 diamonds. This is expensive, but important for balance reasons.
 - Raids and zombified villagers are disabled. This means villager prices cannot be artificially reduced & raid farms cannot be used.

# Rules

 - Generally be respectful of others.
 - Don't build within 300 blocks of spawn (except for shop plots).
 - Don't hack or cheat in any way.
 - Don't steal from other players or destroy what others built.
 - Don't build too close to other people without their permission.
 - Don't take stuff from other people's resource farms unless they're public (e.g. an enderman farm).
 - Item duping is prohibited. If you aren't sure if it counts as cheating, ask bitgardener
 - No promotion of other servers (Minecraft or Discord).
 - Don't be vulgar. Try to be mature at all times.
